# LendingLibrary2

Overview
This project is a Test-Driven Development (TDD) implementation of a Lending Library that allows users to manage books and borrow them using a Backpack. The Lending Library enables users to add, remove, search, and borrow books from the collection. The Backpack can hold a limited number of borrowed books, and users must return books to the library before borrowing more.
